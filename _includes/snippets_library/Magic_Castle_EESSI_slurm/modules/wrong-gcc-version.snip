In _includes/snippets_library/ComputeCanada_Graham_slurm/modules/wrong-gcc-version.snip
there is a long additional section on some specific features of Lmod, in particular
covering the concept of a module hierarchy. While this is not relevant to the EESSI
configuration right now, it may become so in the future if we change the default
module naming scheme to hierarchical.
